# Missing images (grey placeholders)

These project entries reference image files that are **not** in your `images/` folder. Until you add them, those tiles will show as grey placeholders.

| Project | Referenced file |
|--------|------------------|
| angelina 18 | `images/angelina_digitals-18.png` |
| light bg 25 | `images/alexa_lightBG-25.png` |
| DSC05727 | `images/DSC05727.png` |
| untitled 9763 | `images/untitled-9763.png` |

**To fix:** Add these files into the `images/` folder in your repo (same names as in the table), then commit and push. The site will show them once the files exist.

All other previously “missing” images were fixed by pointing to the correct filenames (including ones with long suffixes or different extensions).
