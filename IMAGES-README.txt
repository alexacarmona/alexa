IMAGES FOR YOUR SITE
====================

What "repo" means (simple):
  Your "repo" = the project on GitHub. It's the folder that holds your website (index.html + images folder). When you open github.com and click your project "portfolio-site", that page is your repo. The "root" = the top level of that folder (where index.html and the images folder should sit).

Why some images don't show:
  The site only can show an image if that exact file is in the images folder on GitHub. If you couldn't upload the whole folder (too big) and uploaded in parts, any file that didn't get uploaded will show as a grey box instead of a broken icon. That's on purpose so the site still looks clean.

What to do:
  - Upload as many of your image files as you can into the "images" folder on GitHub (in parts is fine).
  - Each filename must match exactly (including .jpg vs .JPG vs .png).
  - The site will show every image that's there and a grey placeholder for any that are missing.

Your site needs index.html and an "images" folder at the same level (both at the top of the repo). If your repo only has a folder called "portfolio-site" and the files are inside that, see the main README for how to move them to the top.
